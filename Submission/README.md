# Instructions for the submission of MBAS2024

## Instructions for Validation Phase submission

During the validation phase, competitors are required to submit mask predictions (*.nii.gz). We require zipped submissions for both tasks to the submission page.

Validation Phase

During the validation phase, competitors are required to submit mask predictions (.nii.gz). The submission should be zipped as the following structure: 

── teamname_ValPhase_Try1.zip (Note that: total 3 times for validation from Try1 to Try3)

​    ├── MBAS_071_label.nii.gz

​    └── MBAS_072_label.nii.gz

​    ├── ...

​    └── MBAS_100_label.nii.gz

It is of note that your submission should not contain any folders or unrelated files. The file id of prediction masks must be as same as that of the original validation MRI scans (e.g., MBAS_071_label.nii.gz).
